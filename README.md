# PhD - Photocapacitance Modelling

  The last chapter of my PhD thesis was aimed at improving a model that describes how the capacitance-voltage (CV) measurement, in a MIS (Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor) device, would change when exposed to light.
  
  With common semiconductors, like Si, the behaviour of the CV is well understood. The device can be driven to accumulation, depletion, deep depletion and inversion when the voltage across the metal electrodes change. Superimposed to the DC voltage there is also a small AC signal, where its frequency plays an important role. But let me explain better.
